# Momentum Transformer

This code accompanies the paper [Trading with the Momentum Transformer: An Intelligent and Interpretable Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08534.pdf). It is a copy of the repro from [kieranjwood/trading-momentum-transformer](https://github.com/kieranjwood/trading-momentum-transformer)  for testing purposes. 

1. Create a Nasdaq Data Link account to access the [free Quandl dataset](https://data.nasdaq.com/data/CHRIS-wiki-continuous-futures/documentation). This dataset provides continuous contracts for 600+ futures, built on top of raw data from CME, ICE, LIFFE etc.
2. Download the Quandl data with: `python -m data.download_quandl_data <<API_KEY>>`
3. Create Momentum Transformer input features with: `python -m examples.create_features_quandl`. In this example we use the 100 futures tickers which have i) the longest history ii) more than 90% of trading days have data iii) data up until at least Dec 2021.
4. Optionally, run the changepoint detection module: `python -m examples.concurent_cpd_quandl <<CPD_WINDOW_LENGTH>>`, for example `python -m examples.concurent_cpd_quandl 21` and `python -m examples.concurent_cpd_quandl 126`
5. Create Momentum Transformer input features, including CPD module features with: `python -m examples.create_features_quandl 21` after the changepoint detection module has completed.
6. To create a features file with multiple changepoint detection lookback windows: `python -m examples.create_features_quandl 126 21` after the 126 day LBW changepoint detection module has completed and a features file for the 21 day LBW exists.
7. Run one of the Momentum Transformer or Slow Momentum with Fast Reversion experiments with `python -m examples.run_dmn_experiment <<EXPERIMENT_NAME>>`

## Status

* Code base is mostly from Temporal Fusion Transformers (google research)
